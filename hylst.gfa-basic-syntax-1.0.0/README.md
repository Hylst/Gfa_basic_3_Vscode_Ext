## Description
This Visual Studio Code extension provides syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and basic code assistance for the GFA BASIC 3.6 programming language, primarily used on Atari ST systems. While still in beta, the extension will evolve with contributions and feedback from the community, especially if you have experience with developing VS Code extensions. It's free to share, use, or modify on your side as we usually code, in these days, on ATARI ST for fun, nostalgy, personnal challenge, and retro passion.
For GFA BASIC coders on atari, the best is to use the excellent GBE by Lonny Pursell (powerful ATARI needed such as Falcon 030 + MiNT). Specially for GEM friendly GFA BASIC coding. 
GFA Basic author was Frank Ostrowski. More infos on :  [Frank Ostrowski](https://gfabasic.net/htm/gfa_fo.htm)

[GFA BASIC Syntax Highlighting VSCode Extension GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Hylst/Gfa_basic_3_Vscode_Ext/tree/main/gfa-basic-3-6-)

### Features:
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports GFA BASIC 3.6 keywords, operators, variable types (`$`, `&`, `%`, `!`, `|`), and comments.
- **Auto-indentation**: Automatically adjusts indentation for control structures like `FOR...NEXT`, `IF...ENDIF`, `PROCEDURE...RETURN`, `SELECT...ENDSELECT`, and more.
- **Support for multiple numeric formats**: Decimal, hexadecimal (`&H`), and binary (`&X`).
- **Flexible and Customizable**: The extension can be easily expanded to recognize more GFA BASIC keywords and syntax constructs.

This extension aims to improve productivity and code readability for developers working with GFA BASIC, making it easier to code using a modern editor.

### Supported Instructions:
- **Control Structures**: `FOR...NEXT`, `WHILE...WEND`, `IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF`, `SELECT...CASE...ENDSELECT`, `REPEAT...UNTIL`, `DO...LOOP`, etc.
- **Basic Functions**: `INPUT`, `PRINT`, `RAND`, `PSET`, `SETCOLOR`, `VSYNC`, `XBIOS`, and more.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, bitwise operations like `SHR`, `SHL`, and comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, etc.).

For a full list of instructions, refer to the [GFA BASIC reference](https://gfabasic.net/stg/gfabasic.htm). Many still lacks in this extension.
